Scatter 250 Hz   Diffuse 500 Hz   HF cutoff 6500 Hz

Period width  1235 mm

Minimum distance to seating position  2.06m (3 times wavelength of lowest diffusion frequency)

Good result: Period width of  1235mm is is not less than the design wavelength of  690 mm

Good result: The well width is large enough to avoid viscous losses

Questionable result: Plate frequency of  6500 hz is less than theoretical HF cutoff of  6880 hz, so becomes the new upper limit

Questionable result: The HF cutoff frequency of  6500 hz is  13 times the design frequency of  500 hz

True diffusion frequencies:   500   1000   1500   2000   2500   3000   3500   4000   4500   5000   5500   6000   6500 hz

Current auto-well strategy: Auto-adjust well width so that wells are at least 25mm wide to minimise viscous losses
