QRDude report for 2D QRD diffuser
===================================

STANDARD PANEL is based on a modulated series of STANDARD 1D QRD panels
Panel does have fins

Panel order =  13
Design frequency  892 Hz
Number of wells =  169
Panel is shifted 7 wells to the left and pulled 7 rows towards the front

One depth unit is equivalent to 14.8 mm
Build depth is 178 mm

Panel width including additional end fin is 1305 mm

Period width is larger than design wavelength - good!
